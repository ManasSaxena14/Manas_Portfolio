export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am an innovative, quick-adapting, and purpose-driven developer fueled by curiosity and a passion for building solutions that create real impact. I don't just code—I craft, refine, and reimagine ideas into powerful systems that solve real-world problems and inspire progress. Whether it's designing seamless user experiences, engineering efficient logic, or experimenting with new technologies, I thrive on turning challenges into opportunities. Every project for me is more than just a task—it's a chance to push boundaries, grow beyond limits, and shape meaningful innovation. I am eager to explore opportunities where I can contribute from day one, continuously evolve, and make a lasting difference.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I'm a second-year student pursuing B-Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, passionate about tech and innovation, currently exploring the world of software development through hands-on learning and real-world projects. I enjoy solving problems, building clean and efficient user interfaces, and constantly experimenting to expand my skill set. My current toolkit includes Python for DSA and scripting, along with the MERN stack for full-stack development. I've solved over 150 problems on LeetCode, sharpening my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking. Beyond academics, I serve as the Vice President of my college's Finance Club, where I contribute to leadership, strategy, and collaborative growth. Over time, I've developed strong leadership and teamwork abilities, communication skills, and effective time management and discipline that help me balance academics, projects, and responsibilities. Outside the classroom, I've also represented my state in Cricket and Football, experiences that further shaped my discipline, resilience, and collaborative spirit. I'm always on the lookout for opportunities to learn something new or improve what I've built. I believe in developing projects that everyone can use to ease their life, something with a purpose. I love what I do because it challenges me to think creatively, grow constantly, and turn ideas into reality.`;
